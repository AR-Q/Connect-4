# Connect 4

In this assignment, we want to delve into implementing a nice, cute, and easy game called "Connect 4" using numpy arrays.

If you don't have any idea about this game, you can check [this link](https://www.gamesver.com/the-rules-of-connect-4-according-to-m-bradley-hasbro/) and read about its rules.
You can use [this link](https://boardgames.io/en/connect4) to try this game yourself too.

So, after you've become familiar with the game, it's time to start your implementation. In the first place, create a 5x5 table for the game and start implementing its rules and logic.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Using GUI is not our goal in this assignment and doesn't earn any extra marks.
